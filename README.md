# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe in C++

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe game** written in C++ using basic functions, loops, and 2D arrays. It's my first project, and it helped me understand how game logic works and how to take user input in a structured way.

## 📌 Features

- 2-player mode (Player X and Player O)
- Turn-based logic
- Win and draw detection
- Simple text-based UI
- Input validation for moves

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- C++
- Console-based (no external libraries)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-cpp.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-cpp
   ```

2. **Compile the program**:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o tictactoe
   ```

3. **Run it**:
   ```bash
   ./tictactoe
   ```

> 💡 *Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++` or through an IDE like Code::Blocks or VS Code).*
